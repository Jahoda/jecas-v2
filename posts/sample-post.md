# Sample Blog Post

This is a **sample blog post** written in markdown to test the new markdown-based blog system.

## Features

- Frontmatter support for metadata
- Tag system
- Markdown to HTML conversion
- Full compatibility with existing blog structure

### Code Example

```javascript
function hello() {
	console.log('Hello from markdown!');
}
```

This post demonstrates how content can be written in markdown and automatically converted to HTML while preserving all the metadata needed for the blog system.
